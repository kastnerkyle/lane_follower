# Autonomous Lane Follower: Reinforced Q Learning

##Kevin Zhang, Nathan Yee, Yuzhong Huang

###Computational Robotics Spring 2017, Completed in 3 weeks

In this project, we built and trained a Neato to follow a red line on its own using Reinforced Learning. The main engine of the learning component is a two layer convolution neural network attached to a Q-Learning Algorithm. The Neato can use this network to comprehend and learn to follow the line in less than 10 trials, with increasing trials leading to a nearly completely learned robot for following lines.
